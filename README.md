## Overview
The aim of this project was to create a weather dashboard that gives you the option to search for a city, and it will present you with the current weather for that city as well as the future conditions for the city. This also uncluding UV index data as well as this to be colour coded depending the rate of this. The app will always store the city you search for, in order for you to reopen this and if the app is closed and reopened or refreshed it will present the last search that you did.

## Installation
To use this application you will need to open it in your browser and use the search bar on the left to search for a city. You can search for a new city at any time by using the search bar or you can reload a previous search by clicking on the name of the city underneath the search bar. You will always be presented with the next five days weather forecast when you search or open a citys weather report.

You can find the application here:   https://oliviaowen1.github.io/Weather_Cities_Dashboard/.

## Features
When using this page you will be able to search for a city and the weather information for that city will display on the right-hand side of the page. 
You will also be presented with the UV index which will display in different colours based on the level of the index, from green to red. With green being better (based on lower levels) and red being based on higher levels.
Underneath this you will see that there is the next 5 day forecast for the weather report which again includes the date, the icon and the temperature and humidity.
As seen in the image below, you can type your city in to the search box and enter and this will provide you with the information. The city name will also be added to the list of previous searches for you to click on again and reopen if you should choose to do so.

Should you exit or refresh the page, the last search will reopen on left-hand side of the page underneath the search bar.

## Improvements

If i were to do this again i would like to have more time to improve the appearance of the page and use more interactive colour-coding where possible.
